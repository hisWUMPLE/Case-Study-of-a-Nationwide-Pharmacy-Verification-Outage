# Case-Study-of-a-Nationwide-Pharmacy-Verification-Outage

## Disclaimer
The case study is a hypothetical application security and software development lifecycle analysis based on a publicly observed nationwide pharmacy outage affecting prescriber verification for controlled substances. This study does not assert the actual root cause of the incident and does not rely on internal, proprietary, or confidential information. The purpose of this analysis is to examine common ways software systems fail and to demonstrate how application security practices align with the SDLC to reduce the likelihood or impact of similar incidents.
